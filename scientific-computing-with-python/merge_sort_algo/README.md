# ðŸ§  Merge Sort in Python

This repository contains a simple and well-documented implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in Python.

## ðŸš€ What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is a classic **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that:
- Recursively splits the array into two halves
- Sorts each half
- Merges them back together in sorted order

It's known for its **O(n log n)** time complexity in all casesâ€”best, worst, and averageâ€”making it one of the most efficient general-purpose sorting algorithms.

- `merge_sort_algo.py` â€“ The core implementation of Merge Sort with a sample test array.

## ðŸ§ª Example

```bash
$ python merge_sort_algo.py
Unsorted array: 
[4, 10, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8, 5]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14]
