# üèóÔ∏è Tower of Hanoi - Recursive Python Solution

This is a classic **recursive implementation** of the Tower of Hanoi problem using plain Python lists as rods (`A`, `B`, `C`). It‚Äôs perfect for understanding recursion, stack behavior, and solving algorithmic challenges.

## üìÅ Repository Purpose

This practice project is part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coding exercises and is intended to help you:

- Understand how recursion works step-by-step
- Solve the Tower of Hanoi algorithmically
- Visualize how data structures like stacks are used

## üß† Problem Statement

Move `n` disks from the source rod to the target rod using an auxiliary rod, **obeying these rules**:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. Only the top disk of any rod may be moved.
